{"hero": "data/images/styles/oskar-fischinger/hero.jpg", "bio": "Oskar Fischinger was a German-American animator and experimental filmmaker who was active in the early 20th century. He is known for his abstract, non-narrative films, which were made using a variety of techniques, including hand-drawn animation, stop-motion animation, and special effects. Fischinger was born in Germany in 1900, and began his career as a commercial artist and illustrator. He became interested in film in the 1920s, and began creating his own experimental films, which explored the relationship between sound and image. Fischinger's work was highly influential in the development of abstract and experimental animation, and he is considered one of the pioneers of the genre. He immigrated to the United States in the 1930s, and continued to work as a filmmaker until his death in 1967.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/oskar-fischinger/Oskar Fischinger --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Oskar Fischinger --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/oskar-fischinger/Oskar Fischinger --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Oskar Fischinger --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/oskar-fischinger/Oskar Fischinger --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Oskar Fischinger --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/oskar-fischinger/Oskar Fischinger --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Oskar Fischinger --niji"}]}
