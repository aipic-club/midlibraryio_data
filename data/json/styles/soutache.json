{"hero": "data/images/styles/soutache/hero.jpg", "bio": "Soutache, also known as Russia braid is a narrow flat decorative braid, a type of galloon, used in the trimming of drapery or clothing. Soutache is created by weaving a decorative thread around and between two parallel cords and completely covering the cores; this produces a piece of trim with a braided or herringbone pattern. Often woven of metallic bullion thread, silk, or a blend of silk and wool, soutache began to be made of rayon and other synthetic fibers in the 20th century.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/soutache/Soutache --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Soutache --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/soutache/Soutache --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Soutache --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/soutache/Soutache --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Soutache --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/soutache/Soutache --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Soutache --niji"}]}
