{"hero": "data/images/styles/tilt-shift/hero.jpg", "bio": "Tilt\u2013shift photography is the use of camera movements that change the orientation or position of the lens with respect to the film or image sensor on cameras.\n\nSometimes the term is used when a large depth of field is simulated with digital post-processing; the name may derive from a perspective control lens (or tilt\u2013shift lens) normally required when the effect is produced optically.\n\n\"Tilt\u2013shift\" encompasses two different types of movements: rotation of the lens plane relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift.\n\nTilt is used to control the orientation of the plane of focus (PoF), and hence the part of an image that appears sharp; it makes use of the Scheimpflug principle. The shift is used to adjust the position of the subject in the image area without moving the camera back; this is often helpful in avoiding the convergence of parallel lines, as when photographing tall buildings.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/tilt-shift/Tilt-Shift --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Tilt-Shift --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tilt-shift/Tilt-Shift --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Tilt-Shift --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tilt-shift/Tilt-Shift --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Tilt-Shift --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tilt-shift/Tilt-Shift --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Tilt-Shift --niji"}]}
