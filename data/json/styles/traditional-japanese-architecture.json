Sliding doors (fusuma) and other traditional partitions were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-japanese-architecture/Traditional Japanese architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Japanese architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-japanese-architecture/Traditional Japanese architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Japanese architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-japanese-architecture/Traditional Japanese architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Japanese architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-japanese-architecture/Traditional Japanese architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Japanese architecture --niji"}]}
