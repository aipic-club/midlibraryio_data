{"hero": "data/images/styles/steampunk/hero.jpg", "bio": "Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that reimagines the 19th century as a world where steam power and clockwork mechanisms have advanced to become the dominant technology. Notable visual features include an emphasis on brass, copper, and other metals, Victorian-era fashion, and an intricate, handcrafted aesthetic. Steampunk often explores themes of innovation, industrialization, and social change.\n\nInteresting fact: The term \"steampunk\" was first coined in the 1980s by science fiction author K.W. Jeter, and the genre has since expanded to include a wide range of media, from literature to video games to fashion.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/steampunk/Steampunk --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Steampunk --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/steampunk/Steampunk --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Steampunk --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/steampunk/Steampunk --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Steampunk --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/steampunk/Steampunk --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Steampunk --niji"}]}
