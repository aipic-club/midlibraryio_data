{"hero": "data/images/styles/antoni-gaudi/hero.jpg", "bio": "Antoni Gaudi was a Spanish architect and designer who left a lasting impact with his imaginative, nature-inspired style. He studied architecture in Barcelona, where he later established his professional practice. His works, such as the Casa Vicens, showcase his unique approach to design that combined traditional Catalan forms with modernist elements.\n\nGaudi's later works, such as the Park G\u00fcell and the Sagrada Familia, solidified his place as a true master of his craft. The Park G\u00fcell, with its dreamlike landscapes and playful mosaics, was a pinnacle of Gaudi's imaginative style. The Sagrada Familia, an unfinished basilica, has become one of Barcelona's most iconic landmarks and is a testament to Gaudi's belief that form should follow function.\n\nGaudi's use of curved lines, fragmented shapes, and a rich palette of colors, textures, and materials continue to captivate audiences today. His works, including the Sagrada Familia, have been deemed UNESCO World Heritage Sites and draw crowds from all over the world. His legacy lives on as an inspiration to countless architects and designers.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/antoni-gaudi/Antoni Gaudi --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Antoni Gaudi --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/antoni-gaudi/Antoni Gaudi --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Antoni Gaudi --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/antoni-gaudi/Antoni Gaudi --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Antoni Gaudi --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/antoni-gaudi/Antoni Gaudi --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Antoni Gaudi --niji"}]}
