{"hero": "data/images/styles/pre-raphaelitism/hero.jpg", "bio": "The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and art critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner who formed a seven-member \"Brotherhood\" modeled in part on the Nazarene movement. The Brotherhood was only ever a loose association and their principles were shared by other artists of the time, including Ford Madox Brown, Arthur Hughes, and Marie Spartali Stillman. Later followers of the principles of the Brotherhood included Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, and John William Waterhouse.\n\nThe group sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colors, and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian art. They rejected what they regarded as the mechanistic approach first adopted by Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art, hence the name \"Pre-Raphaelite\".", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/pre-raphaelitism/Pre-Raphaelitism --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Pre-Raphaelitism --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pre-raphaelitism/Pre-Raphaelitism --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Pre-Raphaelitism --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pre-raphaelitism/Pre-Raphaelitism --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Pre-Raphaelitism --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pre-raphaelitism/Pre-Raphaelitism --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Pre-Raphaelitism --niji"}]}
