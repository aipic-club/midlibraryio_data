{"hero": "data/images/styles/jacobean-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "The Jacobean style is the second phase of Renaissance architecture in England, following the Elizabethan style. It is named after King James VI and I, with whose reign (1603\u20131625 in England) it is associated. At the start of James' reign, there was a little stylistic break in architecture, as Elizabethan trends continued their development. However, his death in 1625 came as a decisive change towards more classical architecture, with Italian influence, was in progress, led by Inigo Jones; the style this began is sometimes called Stuart architecture, or English Baroque (though the latter term may be regarded as starting later).\nCourtiers continued to build large prodigy houses, even though James spent less time on summer progresses around his realm than Elizabeth had. The influence of Flemish and German Northern Mannerism increased, now often executed by immigrant craftsmen and artists, rather than obtained from books as in the previous reign. There continued to be very little building of new churches, though a considerable amount of modifications to old ones, but a great deal of secular building.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/jacobean-architecture/Jacobean architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Jacobean architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/jacobean-architecture/Jacobean architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Jacobean architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/jacobean-architecture/Jacobean architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Jacobean architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/jacobean-architecture/Jacobean architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Jacobean architecture --niji"}]}
