{"hero": "data/images/styles/ottoman-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "Ottoman architecture is the architectural style that developed under the Ottoman Empire. It first emerged in northwestern Anatolia in the late 13th century and developed from earlier Seljuk Turkish architecture, with influences from Byzantine and Iranian architecture along with other architectural traditions in the Middle East. \nEarly Ottoman architecture experimented with multiple building types over the course of the 13th to 15th centuries, progressively evolving into the Classical Ottoman style of the 16th and 17th centuries. This style was a mixture of native Turkish tradition and influences from the Hagia Sophia, resulting in monumental mosque buildings focused around a high central dome with a varying number of semi-domes. The most important architect of the Classical period is Mimar Sinan, whose major works include the \u015eehzade Mosque, S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque, and Selimiye Mosque. The second half of the 16th century also saw the apogee of certain decorative arts, most notably in the use of Iznik tiles.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/ottoman-architecture/Ottoman architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Ottoman architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ottoman-architecture/Ottoman architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Ottoman architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ottoman-architecture/Ottoman architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Ottoman architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ottoman-architecture/Ottoman architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Ottoman architecture --niji"}]}
