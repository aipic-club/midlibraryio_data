{"hero": "data/images/styles/photogravure/hero.jpg", "bio": "Photogravure (in French h\u00e9liogravure) is a process for printing photographs, also sometimes used for reproductive intaglio printmaking. It is a photo-mechanical process whereby a copper plate is grained (adding a pattern to the plate) and then coated with a light-sensitive gelatin tissue that had been exposed to a film positive and then etched, resulting in a high-quality intaglio plate that can reproduce detailed continuous tones of a photograph.\nThe process was important in 19th-century photography, but by the 20th century was only used by some fine art photographers. By the mid-century, it was almost extinct but has seen a limited revival.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/photogravure/Photogravure --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Photogravure --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/photogravure/Photogravure --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Photogravure --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/photogravure/Photogravure --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Photogravure --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/photogravure/Photogravure --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Photogravure --niji"}]}
