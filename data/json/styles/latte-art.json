{"hero": "data/images/styles/latte-art/hero.jpg", "bio": "Latte art is a method of preparing coffee created by pouring microfoam into a shot of espresso and resulting in a pattern or design on the surface of the latte. It can also be created or embellished by simply \"drawing\" in the top layer of foam. Latte art is particularly difficult to create consistently, due to the demanding conditions required of both the espresso shot and milk.[1] This, in turn, is limited by the experience of the barista and quality of the espresso machine. The term also applies to other beverages containing milk foam, such as cappuccino and hot chocolate.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/latte-art/Latte art --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Latte art --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/latte-art/Latte art --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Latte art --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/latte-art/Latte art --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Latte art --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/latte-art/Latte art --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Latte art --niji"}]}
