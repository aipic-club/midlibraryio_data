{"hero": "data/images/styles/brandon-mably/hero.jpg", "bio": "Brandon Mably is a self-taught textile designer and teacher born and raised in a small seaside town on the coast of South Wales. Since his childhood, he has been interested in color and design and had the opportunity to learn from the renowned author and designer Kaffe Fassett, who described Mably as having \"one of the sharpest eyes for style.\" Mably transitioned from a career in cooking to knitting in the late 1980s after meeting Fassett and becoming his apprentice. He has since organized the running of Fassett's studio and traveled the world with him, gaining inspiration from exotic locations such as Africa, Iceland, Guatemala, and India. Mably is an enthusiastic teacher and believes that most people have a sense of color and design buried within them. He currently teaches workshops titled \"Concentrating on Colour in Design.\"", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/brandon-mably/Brandon Mably --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Brandon Mably --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/brandon-mably/Brandon Mably --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Brandon Mably --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/brandon-mably/Brandon Mably --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Brandon Mably --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/brandon-mably/Brandon Mably --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Brandon Mably --niji"}]}
