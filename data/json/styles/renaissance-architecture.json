{"hero": "data/images/styles/renaissance-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "Renaissance architecture is the European architecture of the period between the early 15th and early 16th centuries in different regions, demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman thought and material culture. Stylistically, Renaissance architecture followed Gothic architecture and was succeeded by Baroque architecture. Developed first in Florence, with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to Spain, France, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact.\n\nRenaissance style places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts, as demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/renaissance-architecture/Renaissance architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Renaissance architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/renaissance-architecture/Renaissance architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Renaissance architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/renaissance-architecture/Renaissance architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Renaissance architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/renaissance-architecture/Renaissance architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Renaissance architecture --niji"}]}
