{"hero": "data/images/styles/ursula-von-rydingsvard/hero.jpg", "bio": "Ursula von Rydingsvard is a Swedish-Canadian sculptor and installation artist best known for her large-scale, abstract sculptures that often incorporate carving, shaping, and layering of materials. Born in 1942 in Sweden, von Rydingsvard emigrated to Canada in the 1970s and went on to study at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.\n\nVon Rydingsvard's works often feature abstract forms that are heavily influenced by the natural environment and by the textures and patterns found in nature. She works with a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and metal, and her sculptures are often large in scale, designed to engage the viewer and to become an integral part of the architectural space in which they are displayed.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/ursula-von-rydingsvard/Ursula von Rydingsvard --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Ursula von Rydingsvard --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ursula-von-rydingsvard/Ursula von Rydingsvard --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Ursula von Rydingsvard --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ursula-von-rydingsvard/Ursula von Rydingsvard --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Ursula von Rydingsvard --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ursula-von-rydingsvard/Ursula von Rydingsvard --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Ursula von Rydingsvard --niji"}]}
