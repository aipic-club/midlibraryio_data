{"hero": "data/images/styles/neoclassicism/hero.jpg", "bio": "Neoclassicism (also spelled Neo-classicism) was a Western cultural movement in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that drew inspiration from the art and culture of classical antiquity. Neoclassicism was born in Rome largely thanks to the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, at the time of the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum, but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. \nThe main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th, and up to the 21st century.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/neoclassicism/Neoclassicism --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Neoclassicism --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/neoclassicism/Neoclassicism --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Neoclassicism --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/neoclassicism/Neoclassicism --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Neoclassicism --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/neoclassicism/Neoclassicism --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Neoclassicism --niji"}]}
