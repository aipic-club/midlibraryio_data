{"hero": "data/images/styles/bruce-munro/hero.jpg", "bio": "Bruce Munro is an English-Australian artist known for creating large immersive site-specific installations that often incorporate thousands of components. He often uses light to create an emotional response for the viewer.\n\nAn owner of a small illuminated display business in Sydney in 1985, Munro went a long road to become an outstanding contemporary installation artist. In 1999, he purchased a derelict farmhouse and outbuildings in Dorset, which became the location for many of his subsequent artworks. In 2003, a window display of 10,000 illuminated stems from Munro was presented in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 2005, Bruce created his first permanent installation, Field of Light, at his farm.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/bruce-munro/Bruce Munro --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Bruce Munro --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/bruce-munro/Bruce Munro --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Bruce Munro --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/bruce-munro/Bruce Munro --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Bruce Munro --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/bruce-munro/Bruce Munro --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Bruce Munro --niji"}]}
