The pigments used in pastels are similar to those used to produce some other colored visual arts media, such as oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process. Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance and gained considerable popularity in the 18th century when a number of notable artists made pastels their primary medium.\n\nAn artwork made using pastels is called a pastel (or a pastel drawing or pastel painting). Pastel used as a verb means to produce an artwork with pastels; as an adjective, it means pale in color.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/pastel-drawing/Pastel drawing --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Pastel drawing --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pastel-drawing/Pastel drawing --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Pastel drawing --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pastel-drawing/Pastel drawing --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Pastel drawing --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pastel-drawing/Pastel drawing --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Pastel drawing --niji"}]}
