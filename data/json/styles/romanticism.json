{"hero": "data/images/styles/romanticism/hero.jpg", "bio": "Romanticism (also known as the Romantic movement or Romantic era) was an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century; in most areas, it was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, paganism, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, as well as glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the classical. It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, but also the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature; it had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism. \n\nThe movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror,  and awe \u2014 especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical impromptu). In contrast to the rationalism and classicism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and   elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/romanticism/Romanticism --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Romanticism --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/romanticism/Romanticism --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Romanticism --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/romanticism/Romanticism --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Romanticism --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/romanticism/Romanticism --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Romanticism --niji"}]}
