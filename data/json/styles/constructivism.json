{"hero": "data/images/styles/constructivism/hero.jpg", "bio": "Constructivism is an early twentieth-century art movement founded in 1915 by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko. Abstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space. The movement rejected decorative stylization in favor of the industrial assemblage of materials. Constructivists were in favor of art for propaganda and social purposes and were associated with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks, and the Russian avant-garde.\nConstructivist architecture and art had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements. Its influence was widespread, with major effects on architecture, sculpture, graphic design, industrial design, theatre, film, dance, fashion, and, to some extent, music.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivism/Constructivism --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivism --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivism/Constructivism --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivism --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivism/Constructivism --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivism --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivism/Constructivism --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivism --niji"}]}
