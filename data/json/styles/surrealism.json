{"hero": "data/images/styles/surrealism/hero.jpg", "bio": "Surrealism is a cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists depicted unnerving, illogical scenes and developed techniques to allow the unconscious mind to express itself. Its aim was, according to leader Andr\u00e9 Breton, to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality\", or surreality. It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media.\n\nWorks of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions, and non sequitur. However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost (for instance, of the \"pure psychic automatism\" Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto), with the works themselves being secondary, i.e., artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/surrealism/Surrealism --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Surrealism --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/surrealism/Surrealism --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Surrealism --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/surrealism/Surrealism --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Surrealism --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/surrealism/Surrealism --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Surrealism --niji"}]}
