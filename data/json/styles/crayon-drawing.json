{"hero": "data/images/styles/crayon-drawing/hero.jpg", "bio": "A crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of pigmented wax used for writing or drawing. Wax crayons differ from pastels, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry binder such as gum arabic, and from oil pastels, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil.\nCrayons are easy to work with. They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors. These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/crayon-drawing/Crayon drawing --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Crayon drawing --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/crayon-drawing/Crayon drawing --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Crayon drawing --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/crayon-drawing/Crayon drawing --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Crayon drawing --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/crayon-drawing/Crayon drawing --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Crayon drawing --niji"}]}
