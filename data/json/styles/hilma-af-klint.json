She is known for creating a series of paintings called the \"Paintings for the Temple,\" produced in the early 20th century before the advent of abstract art as it is commonly understood. Himla af Klint was a member of a group of artists known as \"The Five,\" who were interested in spiritualism and theosophy. Klint's Midjourney generations are beautiful geometrical abstractions mixed with semi-realistic subjects (if lucky :)). Elegant bright colors, fine lines and play with symmetry are the principal features in generations with Hilma af Klint's name in prompts.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/hilma-af-klint/Hilma af Klint --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Hilma af Klint --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/hilma-af-klint/Hilma af Klint --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Hilma af Klint --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/hilma-af-klint/Hilma af Klint --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Hilma af Klint --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/hilma-af-klint/Hilma af Klint --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Hilma af Klint --niji"}]}
