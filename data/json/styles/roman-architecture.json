{"hero": "data/images/styles/roman-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but was different from Greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and to even a greater extent under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed. It used new materials, particularly Roman concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the former empire, sometimes complete and still in use to this day.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/roman-architecture/Roman architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Roman architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/roman-architecture/Roman architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Roman architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/roman-architecture/Roman architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Roman architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/roman-architecture/Roman architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Roman architecture --niji"}]}
