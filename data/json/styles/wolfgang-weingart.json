{"hero": "data/images/styles/wolfgang-weingart/hero.jpg", "bio": "Wolfgang Weingart is a Swiss graphic designer and typographer best known for his role in the development of the Swiss Style of graphic design, also known as the International Typographic Style.\n\nWeingart started his career in the 1960s and 1970s and was influential in pushing the boundaries of traditional typographic design by experimenting with scale, contrast, and legibility. He is particularly famous for his use of sans-serif typefaces, grid-based designs, and asymmetrical compositions.\n\nSome of Weingart's most notable works include his typographic posters and his use of phototypesetting, which allowed him to experiment with type in new and innovative ways. He is also known for his teachings and his influence on a new generation of graphic designers.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/wolfgang-weingart/Wolfgang Weingart --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Wolfgang Weingart --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wolfgang-weingart/Wolfgang Weingart --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Wolfgang Weingart --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wolfgang-weingart/Wolfgang Weingart --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Wolfgang Weingart --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wolfgang-weingart/Wolfgang Weingart --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Wolfgang Weingart --niji"}]}
