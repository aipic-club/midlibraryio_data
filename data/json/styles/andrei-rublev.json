{"hero": "data/images/styles/andrei-rublev/hero.jpg", "bio": "Andrei Rublev, a renowned 15th-century Russian painter, is celebrated for his extraordinary talent in religious icons and frescoes, which are regarded as some of the most significant masterpieces of medieval Russian art. Born in Moscow in the 1360s, Rublev received his training as a painter within the Orthodox Church tradition and spent his career working in various monasteries, including the Andronikov Monastery and the Holy Trinity Monastery in Sergiyev Posad.\n\nRublev's artistic legacy is particularly distinguished by his famous work, \"Trinity\" or \"Hospitality of Abraham,\" which portrays the three angels who visited Abraham in the Bible. His oeuvre is characterized by the depth of its spiritual expression and the subtlety, through which he conveys movement and emotion. The use of muted, soft tones of color is also noteworthy in Rublev's works.\n\nDespite Rublev's fame, very little is known about his personal life. He passed away around 1430, and his art was largely forgotten for several centuries before it was rediscovered in the 19th century.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-rublev/Andrei Rublev --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Rublev --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-rublev/Andrei Rublev --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Rublev --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-rublev/Andrei Rublev --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Rublev --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-rublev/Andrei Rublev --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Rublev --niji"}]}
