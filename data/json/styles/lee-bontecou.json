{"hero": "data/images/styles/lee-bontecou/hero.jpg", "bio": "Lee Bontecou is an American artist known for her abstract sculptures and drawings. Born in 1931 in Providence, Rhode Island, and raised in Pennsylvania, she moved to New York City in the 1950s after studying at the Columbus College of Art and Design and the Yale School of Art.\n\nBontecou's early work was heavily influenced by Abstract Expressionism, and she is often associated with the movement. She is best known for her large-scale, abstract sculptures, many of which feature organic shapes and forms made from materials such as welded steel, canvas, and found objects. These works often have an enigmatic, otherworldly quality that has made them popular with audiences and critics alike.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/lee-bontecou/Lee Bontecou --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Lee Bontecou --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/lee-bontecou/Lee Bontecou --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Lee Bontecou --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/lee-bontecou/Lee Bontecou --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Lee Bontecou --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/lee-bontecou/Lee Bontecou --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Lee Bontecou --niji"}]}
