He was an important figure in the gay and lesbian artistic subculture of New York City in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nInteresting fact: Mapplethorpe was a close friend and collaborator of musician and artist Patti Smith, and the two lived together in New York City during the 1970s. Mapplethorpe photographed Smith for the cover of her album \"Horses\" and created a number of portraits of her throughout their friendship.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/robert-mapplethorpe/Robert Mapplethorpe --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Robert Mapplethorpe --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/robert-mapplethorpe/Robert Mapplethorpe --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Robert Mapplethorpe --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/robert-mapplethorpe/Robert Mapplethorpe --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Robert Mapplethorpe --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/robert-mapplethorpe/Robert Mapplethorpe --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Robert Mapplethorpe --niji"}]}
