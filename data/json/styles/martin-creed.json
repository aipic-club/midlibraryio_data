{"hero": "data/images/styles/martin-creed/hero.jpg", "bio": "Martin Creed is a British artist, musician, performer, and writer. He was born in London in 1968 and is best known for his minimalist and conceptual artworks that often employ simple and repetitive forms, such as lights turning on and off or people running. Creed's work often explores themes such as the relationship between the individual and society, the nature of art and the creative process, and the limits of language and communication.\n\nOne of his most famous works is the installation \"Work No. 227: The Lights Going On and Off,\" which was awarded the Turner Prize in 2001. This work consists of an empty room with the lights turning on and off every five seconds. The piece has been interpreted as a commentary on the cyclical nature of life and the passage of time.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/martin-creed/Martin Creed --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Martin Creed --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/martin-creed/Martin Creed --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Martin Creed --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/martin-creed/Martin Creed --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Martin Creed --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/martin-creed/Martin Creed --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Martin Creed --niji"}]}
