{"hero": "data/images/styles/mudejar-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "Mud\u00e9jar art, also known as Mud\u00e9jar style, refers to a type of ornamentation and decoration used in the Iberian Christian kingdoms, primarily between the 13th and 16th centuries. It was applied to Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance architectural styles as constructive, ornamental, and decorative motifs derived from those that had been brought to or developed in Al-Andalus. These motifs and techniques were also present in art and crafts, especially Hispano-Moresque lustreware that was once widely exported across Europe from southern and eastern Spain at the time. \nMudejar style in architecture refers to the application of decorative Islamic art-styled motifs and patterning to Christian styles of architecture. It is thought to have begun with Muslim craftsmen who applied traditional constructive, ornamental, and decorative elements derived from the Islamic arts to Christian styles of architecture.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/mudejar-architecture/Mudejar architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Mudejar architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/mudejar-architecture/Mudejar architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Mudejar architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/mudejar-architecture/Mudejar architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Mudejar architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/mudejar-architecture/Mudejar architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Mudejar architecture --niji"}]}
