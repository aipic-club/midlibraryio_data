{"hero": "data/images/styles/victorian-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "Victorian architecture is a series of architectural revival styles in the mid-to-late 19th century. Victorian refers to the reign of Queen Victoria (1837\u20131901), called the Victorian era, during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically termed \"Victorian\" architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign, roughly from 1850 and later. The styles often included interpretations and eclectic revivals of historic styles (see Historicism). The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed Georgian architecture and later Regency architecture, and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture.\n\nAlthough Victoria did not reign over the United States, the term is often used for American styles and buildings from the same period, as well as those from the British Empire.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/victorian-architecture/Victorian architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Victorian architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/victorian-architecture/Victorian architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Victorian architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/victorian-architecture/Victorian architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Victorian architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/victorian-architecture/Victorian architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Victorian architecture --niji"}]}
