{"hero": "data/images/styles/light-painting/hero.jpg", "bio": "Light painting, painting with light, light drawing, or light art performance photography are terms that describe photographic techniques of moving a light source while taking a long-exposure photograph, either to illuminate a subject or space, or to shine light at the camera to 'draw', or by moving the camera itself during exposure of light sources. Practiced since the 1880s, the technique is used for both scientific and artistic purposes, as well as in commercial photography.\n\nLight painting also refers to a technique of image creation using light directly, such as with LEDs on a projective surface using the approach that a painter approaches a canvas.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/light-painting/Light painting --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Light painting --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/light-painting/Light painting --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Light painting --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/light-painting/Light painting --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Light painting --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/light-painting/Light painting --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Light painting --niji"}]}
