{"hero": "data/images/styles/andrei-tarkovsky/hero.jpg", "bio": "Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-1986) was a Russian filmmaker, best known for his intense visual style and philosophical implications. His films feature long takes, tracking shots, elements of fantasy and science fiction, dreamlike sequences where time is distorted or paused entirely. He drew heavily on his own background in literature and painting to create visually stunning movies that often explored the human condition through symbolism. An interesting fact about Andrei Tarkovsky is that art house film fans consider him one of the greatest directors in history while mainstream audiences are less familiar with his work due to its slow pacing and complex imagery.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-tarkovsky/Andrei Tarkovsky --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Tarkovsky --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-tarkovsky/Andrei Tarkovsky --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Tarkovsky --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-tarkovsky/Andrei Tarkovsky --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Tarkovsky --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/andrei-tarkovsky/Andrei Tarkovsky --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Andrei Tarkovsky --niji"}]}
