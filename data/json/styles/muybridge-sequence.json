{"hero": "data/images/styles/muybridge-sequence/hero.jpg", "bio": "The Muybridge sequence refers to a series of photographs taken by British photographer Eadweard Muybridge in the late 19th century. The most important of those captured a horse in motion, showing its various phases of movement, and were groundbreaking in their contribution to the study of motion.\n\nMuybridge also captured sequences of humans and other animals in motion using his pioneering techniques, but the horse sequence is one of his most famous and widely recognized works. Muybridge's experiments aimed to settle a widespread debate of the time about whether all four hooves of a horse leave the ground simultaneously when it runs, and the sequence provided the first clear evidence of this phenomenon. But from a larger perspective, his work marked the beginning of the motion picture photography and ultimately helped establish and develop the movie industry.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/muybridge-sequence/Muybridge sequence --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Muybridge sequence --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/muybridge-sequence/Muybridge sequence --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Muybridge sequence --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/muybridge-sequence/Muybridge sequence --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Muybridge sequence --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/muybridge-sequence/Muybridge sequence --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Muybridge sequence --niji"}]}
