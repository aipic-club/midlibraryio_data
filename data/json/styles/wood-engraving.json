{"hero": "data/images/styles/wood-engraving/hero.jpg", "bio": "Wood engraving is a printmaking technique, in which an artist works an image or matrix of images into a block of wood. Functionally a variety of woodcut, it uses relief printing, where the artist applies ink to the face of the block and prints using relatively low pressure. By contrast, ordinary engraving, like etching, uses a metal plate for the matrix, and is printed by the intaglio method, where the ink fills the valleys, the removed areas. As a result, wood engravings deteriorate less quickly than copper-plate engravings, and have a distinctive white-on-black character.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/wood-engraving/Wood engraving --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Wood engraving --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wood-engraving/Wood engraving --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Wood engraving --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wood-engraving/Wood engraving --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Wood engraving --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wood-engraving/Wood engraving --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Wood engraving --niji"}]}
