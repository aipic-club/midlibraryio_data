For any purpose, the process usually uses two chemicals: ferric ammonium citrate or ferric ammonium oxalate, and potassium ferricyanide, and only water to develop and fix. Announced in 1842, it is still in use.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/cyanotype-print/Cyanotype print --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Cyanotype print --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/cyanotype-print/Cyanotype print --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Cyanotype print --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/cyanotype-print/Cyanotype print --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Cyanotype print --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/cyanotype-print/Cyanotype print --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Cyanotype print --niji"}]}
