{"hero": "data/images/styles/tie-dye/hero.jpg", "bio": "Tie-dye is a term used to describe a number of resist dyeing techniques and the resulting dyed products of these processes. The process of tie-dye typically consists of folding, twisting, pleating, or crumpling fabric or a garment, before binding it with string or rubber bands, followed by the application of dye or dyes. The manipulations of the fabric before the application of dye are called resists, as they partially or completely prevent ('resist') the applied dye from coloring the fabric. More sophisticated tie-dye may involve additional steps, including an initial application of dye before the resist, multiple sequential dyeing and resist steps, and the use of other types of resists (stitching, stencils) and discharge.\n\nUnlike regular resist-dyeing techniques, modern tie-dye is characterized by the use of bright, saturated primary colors and bold patterns. These patterns, including the spiral, mandala, and peace sign, and the use of multiple bold colors, have become clich\u00e9d since the peak popularity of tie-dye in the United States the 1960s and 1970s. The vast majority of tie-dye garments and objects produced for wholesale distribution use these designs, with many being mass-produced.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/tie-dye/Tie-dye --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Tie-dye --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tie-dye/Tie-dye --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Tie-dye --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tie-dye/Tie-dye --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Tie-dye --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tie-dye/Tie-dye --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Tie-dye --niji"}]}
