{"hero": "data/images/styles/paolo-roversi/hero.jpg", "bio": "Paolo Roversi (born 1947) is an Italian-born fashion photographer who lives and works in Paris. Roversi has said of his technique: My photography is more subtraction than addition. I always try to take off things. We all have a sort of mask of expression. You say goodbye, you smile, you are scared. I try to  take all these masks away and little by little subtract until you have something pure left. A kind of abandon, a kind of absence. It looks like  an absence, but in fact when there is this emptiness I think the interior beauty comes out. This is my technique", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/paolo-roversi/Paolo Roversi --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Paolo Roversi --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/paolo-roversi/Paolo Roversi --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Paolo Roversi --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/paolo-roversi/Paolo Roversi --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Paolo Roversi --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/paolo-roversi/Paolo Roversi --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Paolo Roversi --niji"}]}
