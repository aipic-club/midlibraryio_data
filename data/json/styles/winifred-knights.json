{"hero": "data/images/styles/winifred-knights/hero.jpg", "bio": "British painter Winifred Knights (1899-1947) is known for her detailed and realistic depictions of the human figure and is particularly recognized for her use of colors and the play of light and shadow to create a sense of volume. She was a member of the New English Art Club and was part of the British avant-garde of the early 20th century. Winifred Knights' Midjourney style is fantastic for highly-stylized portrait (and not only!) paintings permeated by the sense of longing.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/winifred-knights/Winifred Knights --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Winifred Knights --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/winifred-knights/Winifred Knights --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Winifred Knights --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/winifred-knights/Winifred Knights --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Winifred Knights --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/winifred-knights/Winifred Knights --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Winifred Knights --niji"}]}
