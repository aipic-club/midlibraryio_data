{"hero": "data/images/styles/pixel-art/hero.jpg", "bio": "Pixel art is a form of digital art drawn with graphical software where images are built using pixels as the only building block. It is widely associated with the low-resolution graphics from 8-bit and 16-bit era computers and arcade video game consoles, in addition to other limited systems such as LED displays and graphing calculators, which have a limited number of pixels and colors available. The art form is still employed to this day by pixel artists and game studios, even though the technological limitations have since been surpassed.\n\nMost works of pixel art are also restrictive both in file size and the number of colors used in their color palette because of software limitations \u2014 in order to achieve a certain aesthetic or simply to reduce the perceived noise. Older forms of pixel art tend to employ smaller palettes, with some video games being made using just two colors (1-bit color depth). Because of these self-imposed limitations, pixel art presents strong similarities with many traditional restrictive art forms such as mosaics and cross-stitch.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/pixel-art/Pixel art --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Pixel art --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pixel-art/Pixel art --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Pixel art --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pixel-art/Pixel art --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Pixel art --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pixel-art/Pixel art --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Pixel art --niji"}]}
