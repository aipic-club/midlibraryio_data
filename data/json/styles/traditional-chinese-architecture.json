{"hero": "data/images/styles/traditional-chinese-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "Chinese architecture (Chinese:\u4e2d\u570b\u5efa\u7bc9) is the embodiment of an architectural style that has developed over millennia in China and it has influenced architecture throughout Eastern Asia. Since its emergence during the early ancient era, the structural principles of its architecture have remained largely unchanged. The main changes involved diverse decorative details. Starting with the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and the Philippines.\n\nChinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, the use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies), a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological, or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces. Due to the frequent use of wood, a relatively perishable material, as well as a few monumental structures built of more durable materials, much historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published diagrams and specifications.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-chinese-architecture/Traditional Chinese architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Chinese architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-chinese-architecture/Traditional Chinese architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Chinese architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-chinese-architecture/Traditional Chinese architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Chinese architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/traditional-chinese-architecture/Traditional Chinese architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Traditional Chinese architecture --niji"}]}
