{"hero": "data/images/styles/qajar-art/hero.jpg", "bio": "Qajar art refers to the art, architecture, and art forms of the Qajar dynasty of the late Persian Empire, which lasted from 1781 to 1925 in Iran (Persia).\n\nThe boom in artistic expression that occurred during the Qajar era was the fortunate side effect of the period of relative peace that accompanied the rule of Agha Muhammad Khan and his descendants. With his ascension, the bloody turmoil that had been in the 18th century in Persia came to a close and made it possible for the peacetime arts to again flourish. \nMost notably, Qajar art is recognizable for its distinctive style of portraiture. While the depiction of inanimate objects and still lifes are seen to be very realistic in Qajar painting, the depiction of human beings is decidedly idealized. This is especially evident in the portrayal of Qajar royalty, where the subjects of the paintings are very formulaically placed and situated to achieve the desired effect.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/qajar-art/Qajar art --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Qajar art --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/qajar-art/Qajar art --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Qajar art --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/qajar-art/Qajar art --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Qajar art --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/qajar-art/Qajar art --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Qajar art --niji"}]}
