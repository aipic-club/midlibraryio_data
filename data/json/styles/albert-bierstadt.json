He started painting as a hobby, but eventually pursued it as a career after studying art in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Interesting fact: Bierstadt was a member of the Hudson River School, a group of landscape painters who focused on capturing the beauty of the natural world.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/albert-bierstadt/Albert Bierstadt --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Albert Bierstadt --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/albert-bierstadt/Albert Bierstadt --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Albert Bierstadt --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/albert-bierstadt/Albert Bierstadt --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Albert Bierstadt --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/albert-bierstadt/Albert Bierstadt --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Albert Bierstadt --niji"}]}
