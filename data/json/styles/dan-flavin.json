{"hero": "data/images/styles/dan-flavin/hero.jpg", "bio": "Dan Flavin was an American minimalist installation artist and painter. He started his career as a watercolorist and sculptor but later began experimenting with using light in his works.\n\nHe eventually became known for his minimalist constructions that used readymade fluorescent or neon lights and fixtures. Despite their impersonal appearance, his works often had a sacred quality, and he often dedicated them to other artists, making them more human. He was a multi-disciplinary artist who worked in various fields such as architecture, art criticism, drawing, graphic art, installation art, sculpture, light art, painting, and watercolor.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/dan-flavin/Dan Flavin --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Dan Flavin --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/dan-flavin/Dan Flavin --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Dan Flavin --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/dan-flavin/Dan Flavin --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Dan Flavin --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/dan-flavin/Dan Flavin --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Dan Flavin --niji"}]}
