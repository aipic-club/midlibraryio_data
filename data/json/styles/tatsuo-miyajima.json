{"hero": "data/images/styles/tatsuo-miyajima/hero.jpg", "bio": "Tatsuo Miyajima is a Japanese installation artist and one of the leading figures of the contemporary art scene in Japan. He was born in Tokyo in 1957, and he studied at the Kyoto City University of Arts. Miyajima's work is characterized by the use of simple, minimalist forms, often featuring LED lights and numbers, and his installations often address themes related to time, life, and death.\n\nOne of Miyajima's most famous works is his \"Counter of Life\" series, which features LED displays that count from 1 to 9 and then start over again. The repetition of the numbers symbolizes the cycle of life and death, and the artist often incorporates the theme of interconnectivity into his works, suggesting that all things are connected and interdependent.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/tatsuo-miyajima/Tatsuo Miyajima --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Tatsuo Miyajima --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tatsuo-miyajima/Tatsuo Miyajima --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Tatsuo Miyajima --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tatsuo-miyajima/Tatsuo Miyajima --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Tatsuo Miyajima --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/tatsuo-miyajima/Tatsuo Miyajima --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Tatsuo Miyajima --niji"}]}
