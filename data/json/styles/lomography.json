{"hero": "data/images/styles/lomography/hero.jpg", "bio": "Lomography is a photographic genre that relies on a camera rather than on a subject matter or technique. It encapsulates all photographs taken with a Lomo camera. And a Lomo camera is nothing like a modern DSLR or mirrorless camera.\n\nA Lomo camera is a Russian 35mm film camera. It\u2019s an ultra-basic camera with a fixed lens, one shutter speed, and manual focusing. And you have to advance the film manually after each photograph. The results, as you may expect, are full of flaws. Misplaced focus, wrong colors, heavy vignetting, distortions, and blurs are just some of them. But this is exactly what excites Lomography photographers and keeps them going on taking pictures with a plastic camera.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/lomography/Lomography --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Lomography --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/lomography/Lomography --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Lomography --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/lomography/Lomography --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Lomography --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/lomography/Lomography --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Lomography --niji"}]}
