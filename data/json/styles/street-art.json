Street art can take many forms, including graffiti, murals, and installations. Street artists use a variety of techniques, such as stenciling, wheatpasting, and freehand painting, to create their works. Notable visual features include bold colors, intricate designs, and a wide range of subject matter, from political statements to pop culture references. Street art is often associated with urban decay and rebellion against authority.\n\nInteresting fact: The earliest known examples of street art date back to the ancient city of Pompeii, where political graffiti was found on the walls of buildings.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/street-art/Street Art --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Street Art --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/street-art/Street Art --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Street Art --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/street-art/Street Art --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Street Art --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/street-art/Street Art --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Street Art --niji"}]}
