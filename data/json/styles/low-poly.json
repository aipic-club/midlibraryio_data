{"hero": "data/images/styles/low-poly/hero.jpg", "bio": "Low poly is a polygon mesh in 3D computer graphics that has a relatively small number of polygons. Low poly meshes occur in real-time applications (e.g. games) as contrast with high-poly meshes in animated movies and special effects of the same era. The term low poly is used in both a technical and a descriptive sense; the number of polygons in a mesh is an important factor to optimize for performance but can give an undesirable appearance to the resulting graphics", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/low-poly/Low-poly --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Low-poly --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/low-poly/Low-poly --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Low-poly --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/low-poly/Low-poly --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Low-poly --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/low-poly/Low-poly --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Low-poly --niji"}]}
