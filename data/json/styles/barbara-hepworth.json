{"hero": "data/images/styles/barbara-hepworth/hero.jpg", "bio": "Barbara Hepworth was a British sculptor and a leading figure in the modernist art movement in Britain during the mid-20th century and is best known for her abstract sculptures in bronze, marble, and other materials. Hepworth's work explored the relationship between the human form and the natural world, and her sculptures often incorporate organic shapes and curves. She was a founding member of the abstractionist group \"Unit One\" and was closely associated with other leading British modernists. Her work is held in many major museums around the world, including the Tate in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/barbara-hepworth/Barbara Hepworth --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Barbara Hepworth --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/barbara-hepworth/Barbara Hepworth --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Barbara Hepworth --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/barbara-hepworth/Barbara Hepworth --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Barbara Hepworth --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/barbara-hepworth/Barbara Hepworth --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Barbara Hepworth --niji"}]}
