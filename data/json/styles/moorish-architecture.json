{"hero": "data/images/styles/moorish-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "Moorish architecture is a style within Islamic architecture that developed in the western Islamic world, including al-Andalus (on the Iberian peninsula) and what is now Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia (part of the Maghreb). The term \"Moorish\" comes from the historical Western European designation of the Muslim inhabitants of these regions as \"Moors\". Scholarly references on Islamic architecture often refer to this architectural tradition by a more geographic designation, such as the architecture of the Islamic West or architecture of the Western Islamic lands, and some references on Islamic art and architecture consider the use of the term \"Moorish\" to be outdated or contested.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/moorish-architecture/Moorish architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Moorish architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/moorish-architecture/Moorish architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Moorish architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/moorish-architecture/Moorish architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Moorish architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/moorish-architecture/Moorish architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Moorish architecture --niji"}]}
