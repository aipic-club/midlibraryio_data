{"hero": "data/images/styles/ivory-carving/hero.jpg", "bio": "Ivory carving is the carving of ivory, that is to say, animal tooth or tusk, generally by using sharp cutting tools, either mechanically or manually. Objects carved in ivory are often called \"ivories\".\nHumans have ornamentally carved ivory since prehistoric times, though until the 19th-century opening-up of the interior of Africa, it was usually a rare and expensive material used for small luxury products. Very fine detail can be achieved, and as the material, unlike precious metals, has no bullion value and usually cannot easily be recycled, the survival rate for ivory pieces is much higher than for those in other materials. Ivory carving has a special importance to the medieval art of Europe because of this, and in particular, for Byzantine art as so little monumental sculpture was produced or has survived", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/ivory-carving/Ivory carving --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Ivory carving --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ivory-carving/Ivory carving --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Ivory carving --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ivory-carving/Ivory carving --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Ivory carving --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ivory-carving/Ivory carving --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Ivory carving --niji"}]}
