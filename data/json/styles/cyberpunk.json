Notable visual features include an emphasis on neon lights, dark, rainy cityscapes, and a blend of high-tech and low-life elements. Cyberpunk emerged in the 1980s and is often associated with the work of authors such as William Gibson and Bruce Sterling.\n\nInteresting fact: The iconic film Blade Runner is considered a defining example of the cyberpunk aesthetic.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Cyberpunk --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Cyberpunk --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Cyberpunk --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Cyberpunk --niji"}]}
