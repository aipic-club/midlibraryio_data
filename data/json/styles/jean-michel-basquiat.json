Basquiat's visual style is based on repetition, layering, and deconstruction of language and imagery, with references to his Haitian and Puerto Rican heritage and African American history and culture. He was the youngest artist ever to be included in the Whitney Biennial.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/jean-michel-basquiat/Jean-Michel Basquiat --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Jean-Michel Basquiat --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/jean-michel-basquiat/Jean-Michel Basquiat --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Jean-Michel Basquiat --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/jean-michel-basquiat/Jean-Michel Basquiat --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Jean-Michel Basquiat --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/jean-michel-basquiat/Jean-Michel Basquiat --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Jean-Michel Basquiat --niji"}]}
