{"hero": "data/images/styles/ed-paschke/hero.jpg", "bio": "Edward Paschke was an American painter and a leading figure in the Chicago Imagist movement, which emerged in the 1960s and was known for its use of bold colors, strong lines, and often-provocative subject matter. \n\nPaschke was part of a group of artists who sought to challenge the dominant trends in modern art at the time, and his work was widely regarded as a reaction against the more formalist and abstract approaches of the Abstract Expressionist movement.\n\nPaschke's work is characterized by its use of bright, neon colors and its often surreal, pop-influenced imagery. His paintings and works on paper often feature recognizable forms and symbols, but they are presented in unexpected and disorienting ways, creating a sense of tension and unease.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/ed-paschke/Ed Paschke --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Ed Paschke --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ed-paschke/Ed Paschke --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Ed Paschke --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ed-paschke/Ed Paschke --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Ed Paschke --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ed-paschke/Ed Paschke --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Ed Paschke --niji"}]}
