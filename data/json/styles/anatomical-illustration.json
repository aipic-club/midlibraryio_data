The pioneer, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), sketched intricate details of human anatomy, exploring muscles, bones, and organs. He relied on dissection and observation, capturing the body's mechanics with unparalleled accuracy.Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) continued this legacy in the 16th century, publishing \"De humani corporis fabrica\" in 1543. His detailed \nillustrations became a foundation for modern anatomy, revealing \nstructures never seen before. Through the centuries, techniques evolved, incorporating fine pen and ink, watercolors, and, eventually, digital tools.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/anatomical-illustration/Anatomical illustration --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Anatomical illustration --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/anatomical-illustration/Anatomical illustration --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Anatomical illustration --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/anatomical-illustration/Anatomical illustration --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Anatomical illustration --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/anatomical-illustration/Anatomical illustration --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Anatomical illustration --niji"}]}
