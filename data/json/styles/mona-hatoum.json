{"hero": "data/images/styles/mona-hatoum/hero.jpg", "bio": "Mona Hatoum is a Palestinian artist and sculptor from Beirut. She is known for her powerful and thought-provoking installations and sculptures that often explore themes of displacement, political violence, and the human condition.\n\nHatoum's work often employs everyday objects and materials, such as furniture, kitchen utensils, and maps, which she transforms and recontextualizes to create striking and unsettling imagery. For example, in her piece \"Hot Spot,\" Hatoum created a globe made of heated metal rods, forcing viewers to confront the dangers and instability of the world they live in. In other works, such as \"Homebound,\" she uses maps to explore issues of borders, territoriality, and the complexities of identity.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/mona-hatoum/Mona Hatoum --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Mona Hatoum --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/mona-hatoum/Mona Hatoum --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Mona Hatoum --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/mona-hatoum/Mona Hatoum --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Mona Hatoum --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/mona-hatoum/Mona Hatoum --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Mona Hatoum --niji"}]}
