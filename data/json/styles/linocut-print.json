{"hero": "data/images/styles/linocut-print/hero.jpg", "bio": "Linocut, also known as lino print, lino printing or linoleum art, is a printmaking technique, a variant of woodcut in which a sheet of linoleum (sometimes mounted on a wooden block) is used for a relief surface. A design is cut into the linoleum surface with a sharp knife, V-shaped chisel or gouge, with the raised (uncarved) areas representing a reversal (mirror image) of the parts to show printed. The linoleum sheet is inked with a roller (called a brayer), and then impressed onto paper or fabric. The actual printing can be done by hand or with a printing press.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/linocut-print/Linocut print --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Linocut print --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/linocut-print/Linocut print --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Linocut print --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/linocut-print/Linocut print --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Linocut print --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/linocut-print/Linocut print --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Linocut print --niji"}]}
