The term \"Pointillism\" was coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists but is now used without its earlier pejorative connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique known as Neo-impressionism. The Divisionists used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/pointillism/Pointillism --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Pointillism --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pointillism/Pointillism --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Pointillism --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pointillism/Pointillism --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Pointillism --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/pointillism/Pointillism --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Pointillism --niji"}]}
