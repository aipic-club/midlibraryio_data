{"hero": "data/images/styles/vito-acconci/hero.jpg", "bio": "Vito Acconci was an American artist, architect, and designer. He is best known for his pioneering work in performance art and land art in the 1960s and 1970s and for his later works in video, sculpture, and installation.\n\nAcconci's early work was often confrontational and challenging, exploring issues of identity, privacy, and the body. For example, in his 1969 performance piece \"Following Piece,\" Acconci followed strangers around the streets of New York, documenting his actions with photographs and recordings. In other works, such as \"Seedbed,\" he lay beneath a gallery floor and masturbated while his voice and actions were amplified for the audience above.\n\nIn the 1970s, Acconci turned his attention to land art, creating large-scale installations that incorporated elements of the natural world, such as soil, rocks, and plants. His later work expanded into a wide range of media, including video, sculpture, and architectural design. Throughout his career, Acconci's work was characterized by its conceptual rigor, its exploration of the relationship between the body and the built environment, and its use of technology and media.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/vito-acconci/Vito Acconci --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Vito Acconci --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/vito-acconci/Vito Acconci --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Vito Acconci --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/vito-acconci/Vito Acconci --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Vito Acconci --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/vito-acconci/Vito Acconci --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Vito Acconci --niji"}]}
