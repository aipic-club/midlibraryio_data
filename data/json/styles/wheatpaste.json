{"hero": "data/images/styles/wheatpaste/hero.jpg", "bio": "Wheat paste (also known as flour and water paste, flour paste, or simply paste) is a gel or liquid adhesive made from wheat flour or starch and water. It has been used since antiquity for various arts and crafts such as bookbinding, d\u00e9coupage, collage, paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, and adhering paper posters and notices to walls.\n\nA critical difference among wheat pastes is the division between those made from flour and those made from starch. Vegetable flours contain both gluten and starch. Over time the gluten in flour pastes cross-links, making it very difficult to release the adhesive. Using only starch, a fine-quality, fully reversible paste can be produced. The latter is the standard adhesive for paper conservation.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/wheatpaste/Wheatpaste --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Wheatpaste --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wheatpaste/Wheatpaste --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Wheatpaste --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wheatpaste/Wheatpaste --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Wheatpaste --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/wheatpaste/Wheatpaste --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Wheatpaste --niji"}]}
