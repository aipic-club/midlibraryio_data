{"hero": "data/images/styles/erwin-wurm/hero.jpg", "bio": "**Erwin Wurm** is an Austrian artist whose sculpture, performance, and installation work has garnered international acclaim for challenging the conventions of respective domains of art. Wurm's creations play with ideas of mass, volume, and materiality and invite viewers to interact with everyday objects in unexpected ways. They are often imbued with a satirical edge that comments on cultural norms.\n\nWurm's creative output extends beyond traditional art forms, as evidenced, for instance, by his collaborations with Issey Miyake and Vivienne Westwood. These partnerships have resulted in wearable sculptures that blur the line between art and fashion. In 2019, Wurm created a series of public sculptures for the city of Paris, including \"Maison \u00c9croul\u00e9e,\" a giant \"statue\" of a house perched atop a building (!), challenging traditional notions of architecture and the built environment.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/erwin-wurm/Erwin Wurm --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Erwin Wurm --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/erwin-wurm/Erwin Wurm --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Erwin Wurm --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/erwin-wurm/Erwin Wurm --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Erwin Wurm --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/erwin-wurm/Erwin Wurm --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Erwin Wurm --niji"}]}
