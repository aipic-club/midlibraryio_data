{"hero": "data/images/styles/millefiori-glass/hero.jpg", "bio": "Millefiori is a glasswork technique that produces distinctive decorative patterns on glassware. The term millefiori is a combination of the Italian words \"mille\" (thousand) and \"fiori\" (flowers). Apsley Pellatt in his book Curiosities of Glass Making was the first to use the term \"millefiori\", which appeared in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1849; prior to that, the beads were called mosaic beads. While this technique long precedes the term \"millefiori\", it is now most frequently associated with Venetian glassware.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the millefiori technique has been applied to polymer clay and other materials. As the polymer clay is quite pliable and does not need to be heated and reheated to fuse it, it is a much easier medium in which to produce millefiori patterns than glass", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/millefiori-glass/Millefiori glass --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Millefiori glass --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/millefiori-glass/Millefiori glass --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Millefiori glass --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/millefiori-glass/Millefiori glass --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Millefiori glass --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/millefiori-glass/Millefiori glass --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Millefiori glass --niji"}]}
