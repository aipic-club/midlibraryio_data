{"hero": "data/images/styles/thai-puppet-theater/hero.jpg", "bio": "Shadow play, also known as shadow puppetry, is an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent colors or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod, and laugh. \nNang Yai (Thai: \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48) is a form of shadow play found in Thailand. Puppets are made of painted buffalo hide, while the story is narrated by songs, chants, and music.\n\nNang means \"leather\" (\"leather puppet\" in this case), and in common usage refers to a dance-drama shadow puppet show. Nang yai, whose name specifically means \"large shadow puppet\", features life-size puppets, while nang talung (a similar tradition of shadow puppetry whose name derives from Pattalung, a southern city where the tradition has long been popular) features much smaller puppets. Both are particularly popular in southern Thailand.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/thai-puppet-theater/Thai puppet theater --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Thai puppet theater --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/thai-puppet-theater/Thai puppet theater --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Thai puppet theater --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/thai-puppet-theater/Thai puppet theater --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Thai puppet theater --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/thai-puppet-theater/Thai puppet theater --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Thai puppet theater --niji"}]}
