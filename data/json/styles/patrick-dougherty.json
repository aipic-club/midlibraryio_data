{"hero": "data/images/styles/patrick-dougherty/hero.jpg", "bio": "Patrick Dougherty is an American installation artist who creates large-scale sculptures using natural materials such as sticks, saplings, and branches. Born in 1945, Dougherty began his career as a sculptor in the early 1980s, and since then, he has created hundreds of works around the world. His sculptures often resemble huts, nests, or other organic forms, and they are meant to evoke a sense of wonder and enchantment in the viewer.\n\nDougherty's works are typically created on-site in collaboration with local communities and volunteers. The process of constructing his sculptures is often a social and interactive one, and it often involves a sense of community building and teamwork. The sculptures themselves are meant to be experienced rather than simply viewed, and they often become places for people to gather and interact.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/patrick-dougherty/Patrick Dougherty --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Patrick Dougherty --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/patrick-dougherty/Patrick Dougherty --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Patrick Dougherty --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/patrick-dougherty/Patrick Dougherty --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Patrick Dougherty --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/patrick-dougherty/Patrick Dougherty --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Patrick Dougherty --niji"}]}
