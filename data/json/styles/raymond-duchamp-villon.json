Born in 1876, he was the older brother of Marcel Duchamp, the famous Dada artist. \n\nDuchamp-Villon is best known for his abstract, cubist-inspired sculptures, which he began to create in the early 1910s. He was interested in capturing movement and energy in his works, and his sculptures often feature fragmented, geometric shapes that convey a sense of dynamism and motion.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/raymond-duchamp-villon/Raymond Duchamp-Villon --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Raymond Duchamp-Villon --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/raymond-duchamp-villon/Raymond Duchamp-Villon --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Raymond Duchamp-Villon --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/raymond-duchamp-villon/Raymond Duchamp-Villon --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Raymond Duchamp-Villon --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/raymond-duchamp-villon/Raymond Duchamp-Villon --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Raymond Duchamp-Villon --niji"}]}
