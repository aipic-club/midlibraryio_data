{"hero": "data/images/styles/realism/hero.jpg", "bio": "Realism in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality, and avoiding speculative and supernatural elements. The term is often used interchangeably with naturalism, although these terms are not synonymous. Naturalism, as an idea relating to visual representation in Western art, seeks to depict objects with the least possible amount of distortion and is tied to the development of linear perspective and illusionism in Renaissance Europe. Realism, while predicated upon naturalistic representation and a departure from the idealization of earlier academic art, often refers to a specific art historical movement that originated in France in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1848. With artists like Gustave Courbet capitalizing on the mundane, ugly, or sordid, realism was motivated by the renewed interest in the common man and the rise of leftist politics. The Realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/realism/Realism --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Realism --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/realism/Realism --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Realism --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/realism/Realism --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Realism --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/realism/Realism --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Realism --niji"}]}
