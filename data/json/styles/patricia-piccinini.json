{"hero": "data/images/styles/patricia-piccinini/hero.jpg", "bio": "Patricia Piccinini is an Australian artist who works with painting, video, sound, installation, digital prints, and sculpture, focusing on bio-ethics and future dystopias. She is most known for her hyperrealistic sculptures and installations. Piccini's work often addresses themes related to science, technology, and the relationship between humans and nature.\n\nPiccinini's sculptures are often large-scale and incredibly detailed, and they often feature creatures that are part animal and part human or that have been altered in some way by technology or genetics. Her works often explore the ethical and philosophical implications of such changes, and they encourage audiences to consider the consequences of our relationship with technology and the natural world.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/patricia-piccinini/Patricia Piccinini --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Patricia Piccinini --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/patricia-piccinini/Patricia Piccinini --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Patricia Piccinini --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/patricia-piccinini/Patricia Piccinini --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Patricia Piccinini --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/patricia-piccinini/Patricia Piccinini --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Patricia Piccinini --niji"}]}
