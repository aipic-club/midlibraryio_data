He was very successful as a maker of altarpieces in the Marches. Working in tempera only, Crivelli favored verdant landscape backgrounds, and his pieces can be identified by the characteristic use of fruits and flowers as decorative motifs.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/carlo-crivelli/Carlo Crivelli --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Carlo Crivelli --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/carlo-crivelli/Carlo Crivelli --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Carlo Crivelli --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/carlo-crivelli/Carlo Crivelli --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Carlo Crivelli --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/carlo-crivelli/Carlo Crivelli --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Carlo Crivelli --niji"}]}
