{"hero": "data/images/styles/constructivist-architecture/hero.jpg", "bio": "The constructivist architecture was a constructivist style of modern architecture that flourished in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and early 1930s. Abstract and austere, the movement aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space, while rejecting decorative stylization in favor of the industrial assemblage of materials. Designs combined advanced technology and engineering with an avowedly communist social purpose. Although it was divided into several competing factions, the movement produced many pioneering projects and finished buildings, before falling out of favor around 1932. It has left marked effects on later developments in architecture.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivist-architecture/Constructivist architecture --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivist architecture --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivist-architecture/Constructivist architecture --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivist architecture --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivist-architecture/Constructivist architecture --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivist architecture --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/constructivist-architecture/Constructivist architecture --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Constructivist architecture --niji"}]}
