{"hero": "data/images/styles/ornament/hero.jpg", "bio": "In architecture and decorative art, ornament is decoration used to embellish parts of a building or object. Large figurative elements such as monumental sculpture and their equivalents in decorative art are excluded from the term; most ornaments do not include human figures, and if present they are small compared to the overall scale. Architectural ornament can be carved from stone, wood or precious metals, formed with plaster or clay, or painted or impressed onto a surface as applied ornament; in other applied arts the main material of the object, or a different one such as paint or vitreous enamel may be used.", "samples": [{"cover": "data/images/styles/ornament/Ornament --v 5.1.jpg", "prompt": "Ornament --v 5.1"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ornament/Ornament --v 5.jpg", "prompt": "Ornament --v 5"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ornament/Ornament --v 4.jpg", "prompt": "Ornament --v 4"}, {"cover": "data/images/styles/ornament/Ornament --niji.jpg", "prompt": "Ornament --niji"}]}
